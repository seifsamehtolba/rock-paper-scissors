# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors!

## Introduction

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (a flat hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The game has three possible outcomes:

1. Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
2. Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors win)
3. Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually played again.

## How to Play

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Run the game program.
2. You will be prompted to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
3. After you make your choice, the computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The program will determine the winner based on the choices made and display the result.
5. You can continue playing as many rounds as you like or exit the game at any time.

## Getting Started

To run the game program, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, download or clone the repository containing the game code.
